    "# 🐍 Convert Images into Histograms inside a DataFrame 📊  \n",
    "\n",
    "❓ **How can you analyze images with Pandas?**  \n",
    "🙃 **By transforming them into histograms with `np.histogram()` and storing them in a DataFrame!**  \n",
    "\n",
    "👉 **Solution:**  \n",
    "By converting images into histograms, we can numerically represent them in a structured format, making it possible to apply statistical models and machine learning techniques.  \n",
    "\n",
    "🔧 **How does it work?**  \n",
    "1️⃣ Load images from a dataset.  \n",
    "2️⃣ Extract histograms using `np.histogram()` to represent pixel distribution.  \n",
    "3️⃣ Store these histograms in a Pandas `DataFrame`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "🔎 **Why does it matter?**  \n",
    "🚀 Histograms enable image comparison, anomaly detection, and feature extraction without complex preprocessing.  \n",
    "🖼️ They are widely used in computer vision applications like image recognition and pattern detection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "✨ **Real-world example:**  \n",
    "📌 **Business Applications:**  \n",
    "✅ Defect detection in manufacturing 📦  \n",
    "✅ Medical image classification 🏥  \n",
    "✅ Visual content analysis on social media 📱  \n",
    "\n",
    "📊 **Code summary:**  \n",
    "🔹 Load images from `skimage.data`  \n",
    "🔹 Extract histograms from color channels  \n",
    "🔹 Store results in a `DataFrame`  \n",
    "🔹 Visualize differences between images  \n",
